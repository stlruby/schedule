Subject: Sponsorship Opportunity with STL Ruby Meetup

Hi [Sponsor Contact Name],

My name is [Your Name] and I represent STL Ruby, a dynamic community of Ruby developers in St. Louis. Our meetups regularly draw [approximate number] developers and tech enthusiasts.

We are excited to invite you to sponsor our upcoming meetup on [Event Date]. Sponsorship benefits include:
- Prominent brand exposure before, during, and after the event.
- Recognition on our event page, during announcements, and in follow-up communications.
- Direct access to a targeted group of developers – an ideal opportunity for recruitment and brand building.

We offer several sponsorship packages tailored to different levels of involvement. I’d love to discuss how we can collaborate for mutual benefit.

Looking forward to your response.

Best,
[Your Name]
